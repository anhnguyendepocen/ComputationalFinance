[Week 1](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/github/s-broda/ComputationalFinance/blob/master/slides/week1.ipynb)</br>
[Week 2](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/github/s-broda/ComputationalFinance/blob/master/slides/week2.ipynb)</br>
[Week 3](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/github/s-broda/ComputationalFinance/blob/master/slides/week3.ipynb)</br>
[Week 4](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/github/s-broda/ComputationalFinance/blob/master/slides/week4.ipynb)

Alternatively, go to https://notebooks.azure.com/s-broda/libraries/ComputationalFinance/, select a notebook, and `clone` it (requires a free Microsoft account). This lets you run the notebook, or view it as a slideshow using the RISE plugin for Jupyter, which is installed by default on Azure (click on the graph icon next to the keyboard). You can even execute code *while* running the slideshow.
